# My commonly used custom MATLAB functions and code
Commonly used functions. Files in the directory "/function/" are nearly
exclusively written by Benjamin Huang. Of particular interest may be:
* saveFig.m, a wrapper to save figures in a variety of formats with many options. 
* errEnvelop.m, a function useful when creating a semi-transparent filled polygon to represent error.
* doy.m, which takes a datetime object and returns the day of the year it corresponds to.
